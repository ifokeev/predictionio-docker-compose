Queries to illustrate many use cases on a small standard dataset and for an automated integration test.

WARNING: for this to produce the correct result you must:
  1. Import data with
     $ python examples/import_handmade.py --access_key <your-app-accesskey>
  2. Copy handmade-engine.json to engine.json.
  3. Run 'pio build', 'pio train', and 'pio deploy'
  4. The queries must be run the same day as the import was done because date filters are part of the test.
NOTE: due to available and expire dates you should never see the Iphone 5 or Iphone 6.
